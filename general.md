### 1. Lp norm
  - ||x|| = sqr(p)(x_1^p + x_2^p + ... + x_n^p)
  - x is a vector
  
### 2. central limit theory
  - the normalized sum of independent random variables will towards a normal distribution
  - the original random variable can be any distribution, it doesn't matter
  - example:
    - when flipping coins, each time the flipping is independent. 
    - While the probability of getting head or the distribution of mean is normal distributed(approximately)
  - constraints:
    - each random variable is ** identically distributed**
